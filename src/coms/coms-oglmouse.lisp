;;;;
;;;;
;;;;    Modification History (most recent at top)
;;;;
;;;;     9/24/12 removed fixnum assumptions in: com-mouse-define-region, com-mouse-resize-box,
;;;;                mouse-corner-tracking, com-mouse-border-toggle-type
;;;;                com-mouse-scroll-box, com-mouse-page-scroll, com-mouse-limit-scroll-box,
;;;;                mouse-smooth-scroll-internal, mouse-in-v-scroll-bar-internal
;;;;     8/18/11 removed drawing-on-window from com-mouse-resize-box (apparently opengl::rendering-on is
;;;;             not, or has troubles with being, reentrant)
;;;;     8/11/11 com-mouse-resize-box
;;;;     5/20/09 scroll-bar commands
;;;;     2/27/07 border coms changed to use new track mouse paradigm
;;;;             (redisplay-cursor) => (repaint-cursor), (redisplay) => (repaint)
;;;;             remove all (add-redisplay-clue 's
;;;;    11/15/03 com-mouse-define-region uses restore-point-position to handle possible
;;;;             munging of the destination
;;;;    10/29/03 removed flush-port-buffer from com-mouse-define-region, graphics flush
;;;;             now occurs as part of the with-mouse-tracking macro
;;;;             #+ graphics-flush changed to (force-graphics-output) in
;;;;             mouse-{smooth-scroll,line-scroll,in-scroll-bar}-internal
;;;;    10/15/03 display-force-output changed to force-graphics-output in
;;;;             com-mouse-resize-box & com-christmas-tree
;;;;    10/26/03 flush-port-buffer added to mouse-smooth-scroll-internal and
;;;;             mouse-in-scroll-bar-internal
;;;;     4/21/03 merged current LW and MCL files
;;;;     1/15/02 changed com-mouse-define-region to default all args so that calling it
;;;;             from boxer code will no longer blow out.  Instead, it behaves as if
;;;;             the mouse were clicked in it's current position
;;;;     5/15/01 *smooth-scroll-pause-time* changed to 0.005 for smoother scrolling of more
;;;;             complicated rows (like with boxes)
;;;;     5/11/01 mouse-smooth-scroll-internal fixed to provide useful time for timed-body
;;;;             *smooth-scroll-pause-time* changed from .01 to .001
;;;;     2/13/01 merged current LW and MCL files
;;;;     4/11/00 calls to ENTER by mouse coms now check to see if we are entering a box
;;;;             from below and pass the arg to suppress entry triggers
;;;;    10/27/98 com-mouse-limit-scroll-box uses last-page-top-row instead of
;;;;             last-inferior-row
;;;;    10/26/98 refinements to mouse-in-scroll-bar-internal so that lowest scroll position
;;;;             will include a full box of text
;;;;    10/19/98 explicitly setup mouse-screen-row and mouse-x before entering tracking loop
;;;;             for shift click clause in mouse-define-region
;;;;    10/15/98 added initialization for row height array in mouse-in-scroll-bar-internal
;;;;    10/09/98 elevator-row-string used to limit the length row # display
;;;;    10/08/98 new-elevator-scrolled-row
;;;;     8/27/98 Added size reporting in the status line to com-mouse-resize-box
;;;;     8/18/98 Reduce blinkiness in com-mouse-define-region by recycling the tracking
;;;;             blinkers for use in the newly defined region
;;;;     6/24/98 fixed com-mouse-resize-box to handle minimum size redisplay bug
;;;;     5/14/98 fix mouse-smooth-scroll-internal bug which crashed when scrolled down
;;;;             from a newly created box
;;;;     5/14/98 started logging changes: source = boxer version 2.3alphaR
