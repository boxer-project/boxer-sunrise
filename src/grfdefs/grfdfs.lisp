    This contains all of the Interface between Graphics sheets
    and the rest of the  BOXER Editor.  The functions and methods
    which manipulate pixels (as opposed  to graphics objects) can
    also be found here  In particular, the functions which are
    used to draw lines, regions, etc are here.


Modification History (most recent at top)

 1/29/13 removed fixnum math:drawing-on-turtle-slate, draw-wrap-line, with-graphics-screen-parameters-once
 1/29/08 added check for %private-graphics-list to with-graphics-vars-bound-internal
 5/11/06 quick conversion of graphics-sheet to graphics-info will have to come back
         and do this right later, but this should allow us to bootstrap opengl port
10/29/03 removed *sprite-drawing-flush* and (flush-port-buffer)
 9/05/03 #+carbon-compat (flush-port-buffer) in with-sprite-primitive-environment
 2/15/03 merged current LW and MCL files
 2/15/01 merged current LW and MCL files
11/06/99 save/restore-under-turtle checks for and hacks clip mode
 6/29/99 save/restore-under-turtle now handles wrapping
 6/30/98 changed caching scheme for get-visible-screen-objs
 6/30/98 started logging changes: source = Boxer version 2.3
