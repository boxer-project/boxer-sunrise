# Change Log

## 3.4.1 2020-10-29

- Increased scrollbar width a bit for visibility.

- Refactoring various bits to prepare for future work:
  - Namespaced all opengl calls (rather than having them as :use in the :boxer-window namespace)
    Cleaning up the separation between the evaluator and editor to streamline
    future opengl work as well as headless/server boxer and other potential
    display engines.
  - Continue cleanup of file formatting and read macro includes for
    lisp systems/architectures no longer in use.

- Fixed opml export, refactoring export so I can make some improvements and write
  my blog in boxer and export it.

- Boxer-bugs-14 Unifying cut and paste operations while retaining yank.

- Boxer-bugs-22 Added an extra check to ensure the error params are correctly
  interpreted.

- Created the ATTIC to clean up and archive commented out, but interesting
  code.

- Initial fixup of loading boxes over HTTPS. Rewrote previous custom
  code using the well tested `drakma` cl http library.

- Boxer-bugs-13 Fixed default bindings for most (if not all) magic mouse
  commands so they will no longer crash if you don't specify a custom method.
  Fixed return items so they no longer return "Wierd" items.

- Adding additional accelerator keys to the menus
    - Create new Port  cmd-shift-p
    - Flip closet      cmd-shift-os
    - Flip graphics    cmd-}
    - Flip Data/Doit   cmd-]
    - Flip Export      cmd-e
    - Zoom in          cmd-=
    - Zoom out         cmd--

- Boxer-Bugs-17 Adding back in support for changing the mouse cursor
    - In old versions of boxer, there were various options for changing the mouse
      cursors, but it seems to just be stubbed out until now.
    - Adding in support initially again to change the mouse to a crosshair for
      selecting the target of a new port. Added stubs for other keywords found
      around the code base.

- Fixed some of the keyboard macros to enable cross platform keyboard usage again.
  ie. Fixed the keyboard binding on Windows.

## 3.4.0 2020-10-06

- Boxer-Bugs-10 Fixed circular port rendering

- Boxer-Bugs-7 Fixed up `boxer-version` command, updated so it automatically pulls the
  version from the asdf component.

- Removed old expiration code.

- Fixed boxer-function-arglist issues. Fixed issue causing crash (rather than error),
  when not supplying the correct number of arguments to a boxer procedure.

- Continuing cleanup: Convertings mixed space/tab indenting to spaces, reformatting with
  paredit, removing conditionally included code from lisp implementations that are no
  longer in use.
